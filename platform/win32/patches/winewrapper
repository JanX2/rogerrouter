# A wrapper for running an exe through wine.
#
# If this is the first call, we need to set WINEPREFIX to a non-existent
# path [1] under a directory owned by the current user. If this is not
# the first call, we should reuse the above WINEPREFIX (hence that
# prefix should be computable).
#
# The arch (win32 or win64) and the exe file are injected by PKGBUILD.
#
# [1] Otherwise wine will always create a win64 environment, regardless
#     of the WINEARCH environment variable content:
