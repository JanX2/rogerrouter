TODO: This is outdate. We have switched to MXE. Scripts have been adapter, Adwaita theme is currently missing.

This directory should contain everything for:
  - Platform setup with all dependencies (cross-compiling on Fedora) -> setup-mingw.sh
  - Build generation (compile everything using a shell script) -> setup-roger.sh
  - Setup file generation using makensis from local build (non-root interaction) -> create-setup.sh

Following these shell scripts should result in a setup file called: Roger Router-X.YY.exe
