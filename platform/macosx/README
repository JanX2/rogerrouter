These are the steps necessary to compile Roger Router from source on OS X:

Latest version tested: 10.13.2

* Building GTK+ 3 for OS X

    $ curl -O https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
    $ sh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

- We need jhbuild from master instead of gtk-osx preferred stable because of meson support

    $ cd Source/jhbuild/
    $ git stash
    $ git checkout master
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ cd $HOME

- Please note that we have to add the following in our ~/.jhbuildrc-custom:

    moduleset=os.environ['HOME'] + '/PATH_TO_ROGER_MODULES/roger.modules'

-  Setup PATH so we can easily execute jhbuild
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$USER/.local/bin

    $ jhbuild bootstrap

# Note: Bison
# 1. errors (illegal instruction 4): OS X introduced new security mechanisms. Adjustment of gnulib necessary. Vasnprintf needs to be exchanged

# Note: m4-common
# 1. Failure due to diff in Makefile.am (remove line and continue)

    $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap
    $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-gtk3

# Note: ragen
# 1. Needed distclean

* Building Roger Router

    $ jhbuild build roger

# Note: gnutls
# 1. Downloading through ftp took too long, downloaded manually and added it to gtk/Sources/pkgs

# Note: poppler
# 1. Moduleset request a gz instead of xz. Manually fixing solves issue
# 2. destclean required

# Note: python3
# 1. Crash during execution. Solution remove line from configuration for Darwin:
# LINKFORSHARED="-Wl,-stack_size,1000000 $LINKFORSHARED"

# Note: meson
# Download it from official site, and install it within jhbuild shell

Optional: Add more eye-candy:
    Copy settings.ini to gtk/inst/etc/gtk-3.0
    Copy directory win32/themes/Adwaita to gtk/inst/share/themes/

* Test Roger Router

    $ jhbuild shell
    $ roger

If you are done testing your build exit the jhbuild shell.

* Build package for distribution

    - Install gtk-mac-bundler

Then run
    $ jhbuild shell
    $ cd gtk/source/roger/macosx/
    $ sh package

in the macosx folder within the Roger Router sources.
