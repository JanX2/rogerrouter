These are the steps necessary to compile Roger Router from source on OS X:

Latest version tested: 10.12.6

* Building GTK+ 3 for OS X

    $ curl -O https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
    $ sh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

- Please note that we have to add the following in our ~/.jhbuildrc-custom:

    os.environ["CFLAGS"] = "-Wall"
    moduleset=os.environ['HOME'] + '/PATH_TO_ROGER_SRC/platform/macosx/roger.modules'

-  Setup PATH so we can easily execute jhbuild
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$USER/.local/bin

Note: There is a bug in recent xcode version which prevents bootstrap from compile. In this case disable the module_extra_env["pkg-config"] ... line in .jhbuildrc for xcodeversion >= 5.0

    $ jhbuild bootstrap
    $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap
    $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-gtk3

* Building Roger Router


Note that roger.modules in moduleset is a symlink to the file located in the Roger Router sources.

    $ jhbuild build roger

Optional: Add more eye-candy:
    Copy settings.ini to gtk/inst/etc/gtk-3.0
    Copy directory win32/themes/Adwaita to gtk/inst/share/themes/

* Test Roger Router

    $ jhbuild shell
    $ roger

If you are done testing your build exit the jhbuild shell.

* Build package for distribution

    - Install gtk-mac-bundler

Then run
    $ jhbuild shell
    $ cd gtk/source/roger/macosx/
    $ sh package

in the macosx folder within the Roger Router sources.
