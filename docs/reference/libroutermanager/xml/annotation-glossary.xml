        <para>The intention of a Stable interface is to enable arbitrary third parties to
develop applications to these interfaces, release them, and have confidence that
they will run on all minor releases of the product (after the one in which the
interface was introduced, and within the same major release). Even at a major
release, incompatible changes are expected to be rare, and to have strong
justifications.
