These are the steps necessary to compile Roger Router from source on OS X:

* Preface

Please note that we currently build Roger Router for Macos 10.5, so we actually have the following in our ~/.jhbuild-custom:

    setup_sdk(target="10.5", sdk_version="10.5", architectures=["i386"])
    os.environ["CC"] = "/usr/bin/llvm-gcc"
    os.environ["CXX"] = "/usr/bin/llvm-g++"
    skip.append("libiconv")
    moduleset=os.environ['HOME'] + '/roger.modules'

* Building GTK+ 3 for OS X

    $ curl -O https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
    $ sh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

Setup PATH so we can easily execute jhbuild
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$USER/.local/bin

    $ jhbuild bootstrap
    $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap
    $ jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-gtk3

* Building Roger Router


Note that roger.modules in moduleset is a symlink to the file located in the Roger Router sources.

    $ jhbuild build roger

* Test Roger Router

    $ jhbuild shell
    $ roger

If you are done testing your build exit the jhbuild shell.

* Build package for distribution

    - Install gtk-mac-bundler

Then run
    $ cd gtk/source/roger/macosx/
    $ sh package

in the macosx folder within the Roger Router sources.
